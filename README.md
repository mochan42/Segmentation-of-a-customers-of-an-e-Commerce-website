* The aim of this project was to create a segmentation of a database of customers of an online e-Commerce website
* Once the segmentation completed, it was required to forecast how often this segmentation should be updated.

* Forecast of the maintenance interval for the segmentation of customers :<br>
I used a metric based on ARI to forecast maintenance i.e. when the segmentation should be updated: maintenance was found to be required every 3 months<br>
